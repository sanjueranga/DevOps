In my GitHub repository, I'm actively showcasing projects that I've successfully implemented in production environments. My goal is to enhance my expertise in working with AWS products and services, serving as valuable references for my ongoing learning journey. These projects reflect my dedication to continually improve and design top-tier cloud architectures. For confidentiality reasons, I'll use a generic organization name, 'Hodan School,' and functional names during infrastructure provisioning. These projects are not only about demonstrating my skills but also about sharing valuable insights with fellow tech enthusiasts. By creating simplified CloudFormation templates and employing 1-Click deployment, I aim to contribute to the AWS community's knowledge base. Together, these projects form a comprehensive system that can assist engineers in troubleshooting and implementing complex solutions
