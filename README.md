# DevOps Demo Projects

Welcome to my collection of DevOps demo projects showcasing various AWS and CI/CD concepts. Explore the folders below to dive into each project:

## 1. [ S3 Hosting üåê](./s3-hosting)

**Description:**
Experience the power of AWS S3 by hosting a dynamic static website. This project demonstrates how to set up a static site using an S3 bucket and implements a robust pipeline with AWS CodePipeline and CodeCommit for seamless deployments.

## 2. [Kubernetes on EC2 üöÄ](./k8s-on-ec2)

**Description:**
Learn the ropes of Kubernetes from the ground up! In this project, we manually create a Kubernetes cluster using AWS EC2 instances. Discover the core concepts of container orchestration and cluster management.

---

## 3. [EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service üåü](./eks)

**Description:**
Elevate your Kubernetes game with Amazon EKS. Dive into the world of managed Kubernetes, utilize VPC for network isolation, and deploy a full-stack application with a Node.js backend, React frontend, and load balancing capabilities.

## 4. [IaC with Google Cloud and Terraform ‚òÅÔ∏è](./iac-gcp-terraform/)

**Description**
Explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Terraform. This project guides you through creating and managing GCP resources programmatically.

## 5. [Serverless REST API with AWS lambda + APIgateway + DynamoDB ‚òÅÔ∏è](./aws-lambda-rest-api)

**Description:**
Experience serverless computing at its finest! Build a simple yet powerful web API using AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and DynamoDB. Witness the magic of serverless architecture, autoscaling, and pay-per-use pricing while creating scalable, responsive applications with a fully managed NoSQL database.

## 6. [CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins + Spinnaker üõ†Ô∏è](./ci-cd-jenkins-spinnaker)

**Description:**
Dive deep into the world of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins and Spinnaker. In this project, we demonstrate a robust CI/CD pipeline that not only leverages Jenkins for building and testing but also incorporates Spinnaker for advanced deployment strategies. Explore the power of Spinnaker for blue-green deployments, canary releases, and more while deploying a Spring Boot microservices ecosystem. Additionally, this project covers various aspects of CI/CD, including API gateways, service registries, multiple databases, and service discovery clients, making it a comprehensive resource for modern DevOps practices.

Each project folder contains detailed documentation and code examples to help you grasp these DevOps concepts. Happy exploring!
